# Xtructure Data Structures Performance Benchmarks

## Overview

This document presents performance benchmark results comparing Xtructure's JAX-optimized data structures with standard Python equivalents. The benchmarks were conducted on a CPU backend to ensure fair comparison between JAX-compiled operations and native Python implementations.

## Test Environment

- **Platform**: Linux (6.8.0-1024-aws)
- **JAX Backend**: CPU
- **JAX Version**: 0.6.2
- **Python Version**: 3.13
- **Test Sizes**: 100, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 elements

## Data Structures Tested

### 1. Stack (Xtructure) vs list (Python)
- **Xtructure**: JAX-optimized Stack with batch operations
- **Python**: Standard list with append/pop operations

### 2. Queue (Xtructure) vs deque (Python)  
- **Xtructure**: JAX-optimized Queue with batch operations
- **Python**: collections.deque with append/popleft operations

### 3. HashTable (Xtructure) vs dict (Python)
- **Xtructure**: Cuckoo hash table with parallel operations
- **Python**: Standard dict with update/get operations

*Note: BGPQ (Batched GPU Priority Queue) was excluded due to CPU limitations with Pallas operations.*

## Test Data Structure

All tests used a common `BenchmarkValue` dataclass:
```python
@xtructure_dataclass
class BenchmarkValue:
    id: FieldDescriptor[jnp.uint32, (), 0]
    data: FieldDescriptor[jnp.float32, (4,), 0.0]  # 4-element array
    flag: FieldDescriptor[jnp.bool_, (), False]
```

## Key Findings

### 1. **Scaling Performance**
- **Xtructure data structures show significant performance improvements at larger scales** (5,000+ elements)
- For push/enqueue operations, Xtructure becomes faster than Python at 5,000+ elements
- HashTable performance becomes competitive at 10,000+ elements

### 2. **Batch vs Individual Operations**
- Xtructure's strength lies in **batch operations** where JAX compilation overhead is amortized
- Small batch sizes (100-1,000 elements) show overhead from JAX compilation
- Python's single-operation efficiency dominates for small datasets

### 3. **Operation-Specific Performance**
- **Pop/Dequeue operations**: Python maintains significant advantage across all sizes
- **Push/Enqueue operations**: Xtructure overtakes Python at larger scales
- **Hash operations**: Xtructure shows promise for very large datasets

### 4. **JAX Compilation Overhead**
- Clear evidence of JIT compilation overhead for small operations
- Performance crossover point typically around 5,000 elements
- Suggests Xtructure is optimized for larger-scale, GPU-accelerated workloads

## Use Case Recommendations

### Choose Xtructure When:
- Working with **large datasets** (5,000+ elements)
- Performing **batch operations** frequently
- Planning to **scale to GPU** computation
- Need **structured data** with complex nested fields
- Building **neural network** or **scientific computing** pipelines

### Choose Python Standard Libraries When:
- Working with **small datasets** (<5,000 elements)
- Performing frequent **individual operations**
- Need **maximum single-operation performance**
- Building **traditional application** logic
- Prioritizing **simplicity** over scalability

## Technical Notes

### Limitations
1. **CPU Testing Only**: BGPQ requires GPU for optimal performance
2. **Compilation Overhead**: JAX JIT compilation affects small-scale performance
3. **Memory Usage**: Not measured in this benchmark
4. **Single-threaded**: No parallel CPU execution tested

### Future Work
- GPU benchmarks with CUDA backend
- Memory usage comparison
- Multi-threaded performance analysis
- BGPQ evaluation on GPU
- Larger scale testing (100K+ elements)

## Conclusion

Xtructure data structures demonstrate **strong scalability characteristics** and are well-suited for **large-scale, batch-oriented workloads**. While Python's standard libraries excel at small-scale operations, Xtructure shows clear advantages when working with larger datasets, particularly for scenarios that will eventually scale to GPU computation.

The performance crossover point around 5,000 elements suggests that **Xtructure is designed for the "big data" and ML use cases** where JAX excels, rather than replacing Python's excellent built-in data structures for general programming tasks.
